# Pre Assessment - Coding

Please download [this file](https://github.com/jonathan-chin/mec-cs/blob/main/2024-summer/preassessment_coding.pdf). It contains 5 coding problems. As best as you can, for each problem, write a `.py` file that accomplishes the task. Name the `.py` file in the following format: `q#.py`. For example, `q1.py` will answer question 1, `q2.py` will answer question 2, etc.

Once you are done, upload all of the files to our [Airtable](https://airtable.com/appudInR1oW4SZ2yy/shrDgCDdULdC9MuMt)
