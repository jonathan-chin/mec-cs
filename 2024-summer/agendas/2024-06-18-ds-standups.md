# Data Science Standups
## 2024-06-18

## Purpose

As an engineer, you will often have to discuss your work, proposals, bugs, etc during team meetings, often called standups. As a data science engineer, this is often doubly true since data science engineers usually make up a smaller portion of the company. The purposes of this activity are:

1. To practice finding and evaluating datasets on Kaggle
2. To practice reading and understanding datasets and notebooks on Kaggle
3. To practice technical communication.

## Task

Your task is to pair up with another student. Together, browse through the datasets on Kaggle and find one that seems good. Some aspects you might consider when looking at a dataset are:

- the usability score (note: this is only provided on Kaggle)
- the author of the dataset, ie are they reliable
- the specificity of the data, eg how many columns does it have
- the size of the data, ie how many rows it has; generally, larger datasets are better
- how interesting the topic is

Then, look through the `Code` tab and find an interesting notebook that analyzes the dataset. Read through it to make sure it provides interesting insights. Once you have selected the a good notebook, fill out the `Data Science Standup Topics` table in our [Review and Goal Setting document](https://t.ly/9KsMb).

Prepare a 2 minute presentation where you:
1. Introduce the dataset briefly
2. Talk about 2 questions the notebook answers
3. Present 2 questions of your own that the notebook does not answer (or does not answer in depth)

Reminder: the `dataset` is the information and the `notebook` is all the code that cleans, processes, and visualizes the information.

At the end of the activity, your team will present! You can decide among yourselves how this presentation is divided.
