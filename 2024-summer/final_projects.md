# Final Projects

Some of you will be working solo and others will be working in groups.

## Solo Projects

You have the choice of doing 1 of these 3 projects:

- [NYC SHSAT and Vietnam HS Scores](https://www.datacamp.com/datalab/w/96f1c7ca-7aa9-4418-a4d3-87cc4f306b48/edit)
- [Nobel Prize Winners and Olympic Medals](https://www.datacamp.com/datalab/w/cc86d582-4ba8-43a6-9b31-ec410c68dfd3/edit)
- []()

## Group Projects

Using a dataset of your choice, your project will require:

- data cleaning
- exploratory data analytics
- data visualization

Additionally, you must choose to incorporate at least 1 of the following components:

- Supervised Machine Learning  
Used for prediction and classification tasks.  
Examples: predicting house prices based on some features such as location and square footage, classifying a patient based on their symptoms as having a specific illness or not, predicting stock prices.  
Needs labeled data. Notice that in a dataset you can choose any column as the label. For example, in a dataset of historic house prices you can choose the price as a label.

- Sentiment Analysis  
Detects emotions (sentiment) in text data about a particular product, service, topic, event, etc.  
Examples: Using tweets to detect how people feel about the Presidential candidates or about the latest Marvel movie (Deadpool vs Wolverine)  
Good for textual data. Visualizations should include a word cloud.

  - Datacamp Word Frequency Project: https://app.datacamp.com/learn/projects/1633
- Recommender Systems 
Uses data to help "guess"  things (products, services, etc.) that people might like among an exponentially growing number of options.  
Examples: recommending movies to watch, products to buy, articles to read, etc.  
Collaborative filtering in particular is very simple; it recommends items that a user might like on the basis of reactions (likes and dislikes) by similar users.

To gather your data, you will be required to use:

- [Web Scraping](https://towardsdatascience.com/web-scraping-regular-expressions-and-data-visualization-doing-it-all-in-python-37a1aade7924)
- [API access](https://medium.com/@samuel7.ag.gis/deep-dive-into-the-twitter-api-c5c7d0df95b7)
- If using Machine Learning / Prediction, you can use already prepared labeled data
